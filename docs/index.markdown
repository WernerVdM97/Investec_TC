# Who Are We

We are a group of postgraduate engineering students from Stellenbosch University. We have a strong interest in software development and specifically various machine learning techniques and applications. 

While our current research differs in scope and focus between group members, each one of us has had or is currently researching techniques applicable to low resource languages. 

The group is very excited to tackle a problem in the crypto space and to get exposure to blockchain development.

# The Team

## Christiaan Jacobs

I graduated as an electric and electronic engineer and am currently pursuing my postgraduate studies at the University of Stellenbosch. My work focuses on signal and speech processing specifically for low resource languages. I have a passion for working with computers and using them to solve real-world problems. In my spare time, I like to go hiking in the mountains and spending time with friends and family.
